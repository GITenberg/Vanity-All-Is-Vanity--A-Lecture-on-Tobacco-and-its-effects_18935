"Strive; for the grasp of the destroyer is upon you, and if you be not
wrenched away, it will palsy you and crush you. Strive for the foe has
seized upon your vitals: he holds possession of your Fort and renders
your will a thing to be controled instead of a controling power. It
chains the intellect and bids defiance to your better judgment. Strive
like one who knows he has grappled with Death and the victory must be
won or self be lost!"
</p>
<p>
TOBACCO should never be mentioned except as a poison, one of the most
active and fatal of poisons; it is the only herb known to possess two
active deadly poisons, <span class="sc">Nicotina</span> and <span class="sc">Nicotianin</span>: It is really so fatal
that doctors seldom administer it, and never internally. For an over
dose of Opium, Arsenic, or Strychnine, when taken in time, there is a
cure, but for an over dose of tobacco there is none; its effect on the
system is Paleness, Nausea, Giddiness, Lessening of the heart's action,
Vomiting, Purging, Cold-sweating, and utter Prostration, such as no
other poison can induce, then death! Its evils are numerous we will
notice a few as follows.
</p>
<p>
1. It impregnates the whole system with two of the most fatal poisons,
<span class="sc">Nicotina</span>, and <span class="sc">Nicotianin</span>.
</p>
<p>
2. With either of which the system is subjected to continuous repair,
therefore Doctors seldom advise one to quit it. It is too much like
taking bread and butter from their babe's mouths.
</p>
<p>
3. It enslaves a man so that it requires a powerful exertion to break
its chains and fetters to regain their freedom.
</p>
<p>
4. It causes dyspepsia by spitting off the saliva that ought to go to
digest the food, aid the digestive system, and to regulate and heal the
bowels.
</p>
<p>
5. When you breathe the smoke it produces asthma and lays the foundation
for a train of other fatal diseases.
</p>
<p>
6. In breathing the two poisons into the lungs, often produces paralysis
of the lungs and consumption.

<img src="images/w-t1.png" height="20" style="width:500px;" alt="" />

<p>
7. It gradually weakens and destroys the whole nervous system and is the
cause of a large majority of cases of Insanity, which can readily be
found in all stages, among those who use tobacco.
</p>
<p>
8. It makes one appear to be ill-bred and extremely distasteful in
society.
</p>
<p>
9. It is said by critics to entirely destroy a certain faculty of the
mind.
</p>
<p>
10. It renders one's breath very repugnant to a companion.
</p>
<p>
11. It is continually drawing on the pocket for the small change that
might be laid up.
</p>
<p>
12. When taken as snuff it wonderfully impairs and often paralyzing and
destroys the Olfactory nerves and deprives one of the sense of smell.
</p>
<p>
13. It creates a craving for Alcoholic drinks, it prostrates the system
to such an extent that nature calls for aid by stimulants, hence the
craving for drinks, peppers, mustards, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
14. It creates an inordinate desire for excitement such as Noose and
Novel reading, and a loathing of Science and Philosophy.
</p>
<p>
15. The smoke has a wonderful tendency to weaken and impair the
eye-sight.
</p>
<p>
16. Its use is an evil example to the young who look to us for advice
and protection from evil.
</p>
<p>
17. It decomposes and devitalizes the electrovita fluid in the human
system.
</p>
<p>
18. The system of the tobacco users is always in a morbid condition,
as proof when you are sick you can't use it; for be it known that two
morbid conditions can not exist in the system at the same time; one
will drive out the other.
</p>
<p>
19. The poison is transmitted to the unborn infant, many times impairing
its vital organs and causing a pre-mature death: and I once heard a
Physician of much learning and practic, Dr. <span class="sc">Niles</span>. Say that there never
was nor ever could be a <span class="sc">healthy child</span> born of parents who were habitual
tobacco users. And I apprehend that every doctor of note in the land
will witness the same thing.
</p>
<p>
TOBACCO EATERS! Is the most appropriate name for the users of Tobacco;
as much so as the vile disgusting loathsome green worm that swallows the
poison leaf into its stomach. For the poison of the quid and the smoke
is taken up by the blood vessels and absorbents of the mouth, and
carried into the circulation, even in a more virulent form than if
introduced by the stomach.

<p>
Every doctor will tell you that he is more afraid to give tobacco,
even as an enema, than any other poison in the Materia Medica: he
never gives it by the stomach. Sometimes, in violent spasmodic colic,
or strangulation of the bowels, or spasmodic croup, tobacco is used
externally as a poultice, and if you are not very careful, it will kill
your patient even in this form. Many a colt and calf has been killed by
rubbing them with tobacco juice to kill the lice. Tobacco is death to
all kinds of parasitical vermin; it will kill the most venomous reptiles
very quick. Many children have been killed by the application of tobacco
for lice titter sores &amp;c. Dr. Mussey tells of a woman that rubbed a
little tobacco juice on a ring worm, not larger than a 25 cts. on her
little girl's face; and if a physician had not been quickly summoned
the child would have died. He tells of a father who killed his son by
putting tobacco spit on a sore on his head. You would do well to read
what various medical men have written on the subject. Every other poison
vegetable is content with one poison; but tobacco has two of the most
deadly poisons in the vegetable kingdom. This is no scare-crow put up
to frighten you Tobacco Eaters; if you don't believe me just examine
a vegetable chemistry, and to convince your self more thoroughly, just
drop one drop of nicotina or nicotianin on the tongue of a Cat or a
Dog, that you don't wish to kill by the tedious method or shooting or
drowning, and see what the effect will be. See if Strychnine will do
its work so quick.
</p>
<p>
Doctors: men whose profession is to play with poisons as with so many
deadly vipers, stand back and behold its poisoned fangs with horrow, not
daring to lay hold on it and use it as a medicine for his sick wife or
child. No he shuns it with a deathly horrow! Though himself may be a
SLAVE to the slower action of its devitalizing powers on mind and body.
</p>
<p>
An over dose of tobacco is incureable because of its peculiar effect
upon the system. The effect is known by a deathly paleness and sickness,
then the air suddenly becomes too warm and oppressive, the patient
desires a cool situation, a drink of cold water and a fresh breeze,
the strangest of all is at the same time the patient is so stimulated
the action of the heart decreases, and to give a stimulant to increase
it, it increases its virulence in proportion to the increase of the
suffocating and sickening sensation: and to give the medicine to allay
that, still decreases the motion of the heart's action. Thus an antidote
is instantly transformed into fuel to feed the unquenchable flame that
is already devouring the human vitals.

<p>
It is no use in telling you by this time that I talk not about tobacco
"like a book," but like one who has been tobacconized. For I have been
one of those unfortunate boys who never had an opportunity of learning
any thing except from that cross old pedagogue Experience, who
invariably compelled me to work out my own problems, often have I in
scalding tears of bitter regret.
</p>
<p>
Tobacco like alcohol gives a temporary stimulus, and to slack off the
use of it, it will produce similar effects.
</p>
<p>
Nicotina and Nicotianin are the proper fathers to the following
diseases,&mdash;Dispepsia, Water-brash, Cancer, Ramollissement, Impotence,
Fatuity, Caries, Consumption, Laryngitis, Cardialgia, Angina Pectoris,
Neuralgia, Paralysis, Amaurosis, Deafness, Liver Complaint, Apoplexy,
Insanity, Hippochondriasis, "Horrors," "Blues," and so on through the
greater part of the Nosological family.
</p>
<p>
Because you are not killed outright you flatter your self that you are
not poisoned, but I tell you that you are, and you are dying by inches
or by sixteenths of inches if you please, how ever small the effect on
you it has some effect and finally by a continual pressing of that
effect it will kill you. Put your ear to the huge locust tree and hear
the gentle grating of a bore worm. Thou insignificant worm! What dost
thou hope to do with that monster tree? Grate, grate, grate! For years
that almost imperceptible grating goes on, while the mighty locust lifts
its towering branches in fancied security. Finally, a storm comes and
the locust hopes to brave it as he has many others; but, alas, its
strength is undermined; Its vitals are eaten away, and it falls,&mdash;a
victim to the tiny worm. Thus does tobacco, or alcohol, or opium, or
any other poison when taken habitually, undermine the system, slowly,
imperceptibly,&mdash;but surely.
</p>
<p>
Go into any tobacco factory of cigars, snuff, or plug, and bring out
a healthy man if you can.

<p>
Tobacco so destroys the sensations and functions of the mouth that,
mild natural drinks, are not tasted; hence one craves strong drinks,
something that will goad the deadened nerves into action. It produces
a state of exhaustion in the whole system that calls for an artificial
stimulus. Alcohol, ever true to its companion, steps in and supplies
this artificial stimulus. It is a scientific fact that tobacco is
responsible for more drunkards than alcohol. I know from my own
experience, that smoking naturally calls for drinking. Walk through your
town and look at the signs, and you will see them allied under the same
colors, "liquors and cigars," "beer and pipes,"&mdash;always. When biddy can
furnish but one decanter there you can get 'two cigars for a cent.'
When a party of old gout-toed wine-bibers make a supper what do they
do? Drink and smoke. When a party of Indians, trappers or soldiers gets
to town "to have a blow out," what do they do? Drink and smoke. When
"bloods" go out on a 'bender' what do they do? Drink and smoke. When
low unprincipled men, thieves, villians, rowdies, rakes, murderers, the
filth and offscourings of humanity meet together to carouse or design
devilish schemes, what do they do? Drink and smoke.

<h2>
    CHAPTER 2.
</h2>
<h3>
    TOBACCO FROM A MORAL STAND-POINT.
</h3>
<p>
Go to our jails and penitentiaries and you will find their inmates,
almost to a man, tobacco-eaters and alcohol drinkers. As the chameleon
takes its color from the object it is attached to, so does the mind of
man, from the body it is attached to. No wonder, then, that a brain
poisoned, will suggest poisoned thoughts, criminal thoughts and acts.
O that preachers might know this, or, knowing it, might act on it in
their efforts to regenerate man's moral nature. Let them commence at the
root of evil to remove it. Evil, like a Cancer, while the root remains
the canker grows worse. Mind and body is united in every effort, if the
main spring is weakened so is the stroke. "A bitter fountain can not
send forth a pleasant stream."
</p>
<p>
When we undertake to reform a man the first thing is to see that the
brain is healthy; not poisoned and diseased. For an unhealthy organ can
not perform healthy functions. You might as well try to improve the
sense of smell with the nose stuffed full of snuff, as to try to improve
the moral sense while it is poisoned with the essence of snuff. Try to
change a man's heart that is palpitating with poison and lusting for
more! If you wish to be a successful soul doctor, you must commence at
the seat of all moral diseases; a poisoned and disordered mind. Take the
poison out of him first, and keep it out for at least thirty days, until
the brain can begin to have its natural healthy action, and then he will
arise and walk in dry places seeking rest.
</p>
<p>
We affirm, and shall prove in the course of our lecture, that tobacco
obtudes and destroys the moral as well as every other sense of the human
intellect. Proof. When you see a habitual tobacco user in the company of
his friends you will see him either squirting his poison fluid over his
friend's hearth, house, floor, and stove, and breathing his loathsome
poisonous breath into the face of his friend, or pouring his poison
smoke into the eyes, nose, and lungs of all present. When all present
are coughing strangling and almost out of breath; they say please don't
smoke any more in the house. Then comes the oft' repeated "Excuse me
I did not think." Can a moral man so far intrude upon the health,
happiness and peace, even of a race of cannibals? "I did not think," is
an acknowledgment that his thinking faculties are not in order. That is
what we know.
</p>
<br />
</div>

<img src="images/w-t1.png" height="20"  style="width:100%;" alt="" />

<p>
Now, it is no use to tell me that a man who can't think, what he is
doing in small moral and social points of good breeding, with which he
is every day familiar. How much less qualified is he for deep moral and
intellectual reasoning which he is entirely unacquainted with?
</p>
<p>
Furthermore. If he does think, his refined and gentle humane feelings
are so benumbed as to cause him not to care, it shows his spiritual
nature is too much deadened to teach the spirit of a pure and undefiled
religion which teach kindness love and attention to all men.
</p>
<p>
A poisoned body, especially when chronic, deadens the nerves and clogs
the intellect, darkens the mind, smokes and blackens the soul to such
an extent he can neither teach or understand as a man ought to do by
nature.
</p>
<p>
What think you of a preacher of Christ with a cud in his mouth squirting
poison at the souls he is trying to save? Is the thing possible? Talk of
distilling the essence of Christianity through a poison worm of tobacco!
O, thou tobacco-eating hypocrite! Can a body that is defiled with poison
and polluted with the sin of self-abuse be a fit dwelling place for the
Holy Ghost? How can a man who stinks like a rank tobacco-pipe, call
himself a fit vessel to stand before the Lord to represent God and the
Souls of men, to proclaim the word of God while his tongue is reeking in
deadly poison and his brain befuddled with its influence? O, thou worse
than Baalam! Would that every ass might rebuke thee.
</p>
<p>
It is a common thing for temperance lecturers to denounce alcohol on the
strength of tobacco, that is, lecture with a cud in their mouths. Now
this is mean. There should be honor among thieves. Don't laugh at and
taunt your brother, wallowing there in the mud, while your own mouth
is full of a thousand times filthier filth. Don't grow poetical on the
"drunkard's aspen hand," when your own poisoned nerves will quiver worse
than his if you should abstain from your quid three hours. You have yet
to learn that tobacco produces delirium tremens, which you so much love
to picture to the drunkard, with all the glowing colors of pandemonium.

Dr. Mussey says he was acquainted with a gentleman in Vermont who
conscientiously abstained from all intoxicating drinks and yet died of
delirium tremens. Dr. Lauren and many other medical writers speak of
similar cases within their knowledge. Many of our best physicians concur
the opinion in that many of the cases of delirium tremens imputed to
alcohol are mostly due to the use of tobacco.
</p>
<p>
You ought never listen to a self styled temperance-man who lectures a
drinker, with his mouth full of tobacco juice. The drinker if he uses
no tobacco is the most temperate man of the two. It is a gross insult
to an audience to eject on them alcoholic vituperation and nicotianic
expectoration at the same time. That audience should say; first go
reform thy-self thou intemperate SLAVE of poison!
</p>
<p>
We have no room for the introduction of proof of our assertions on the
evils of tobacco. But if you wish to have an abundance of evidence that
tobacco produces the diseases which we herein mention you will just
please to consult Dr. Lizars, he will furnish you with cases and proof.
Read Dr. Mussey's 'Essay on Tobacco,' published by the American Tract
Society. And here let me ask all who have the good of humanity at heart,
to place this lecture in the hands of every one of your tobacconized
neighbors. The circulation of anti-tobacco and anti-alcohol tracts will
do more good than all other tracts besides. For those are the root and
foundation of almost every disorder of mind and body, even upon those
who never used it: for it is written: "I will visit the sins and
iniquities of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's
children, unto the third and fourth generation," of them that violate
the laws of nature and their own being.
</p>
<p>
A wise man hath said look not on the wine when it is red. But a wiser
than he hath decreed that they only who seek after wisdom shall find it,
that fools shall be afflicted because of their transgressions, and that
whosoever refuseth instruction shall destroy his own soul.
</p>
<p>
He that is capable of reflection must perceive that whatever disorders
the nerves disorders the brain and the mind, also the morals, then it
corrupts society, possibly for generations to come. You must also
perceive that Life and Death, Health and Disease, are alike transmitted
with the germ of the unborn being. That a diseased and poisoned body can
not transmit a healthy germ. You see that the seed of an apple that grew
on a hollow tree will never produce a sound tree. Then why expect an
affected and poisoned body and mind, to produce those that are active
and strong?

<p>
It is not on the external condition in which you find your self placed,
but on the part which you are to act, that your welfare or unhappiness,
your honor or dishonor, your health or diseases depends. When beginning
to act that part, what can be of greater interest to you, than to throw
off the poison chains of mental slavery, keeping both mind and body free
from such abject servitude. Freedom of mind and body insures health,
long life and happiness. When the whole of the machinery, mental and
physical, is clean, its strength and elasticity is so much better, its
retentiveness is much more vivid and comprehensive that one is mostly
spared the pain of irretrievable errors.
</p>
<p>
If instead of exerting reflection in so critical a moment you deliver
yourselves up to levity, sloth and slavery of habit and poison, what can
you expect to follow? Will wisdom tread the path of folly? Can you thus
abuse both the mind and body, and call yourselves unspotted from the
world, or call yourselves the children of a pure God? O thou spiritual
blind guide! Where are you leading the people to by precept and example?
You have led and allowed the nations to walk into the ditch.
</p>
<p>
Habit is harder to serve than a king, and its taxes are greater, for
they not only come yearly, but daily and hourly, on body, mind and
pocket. You are bound in her chains and must answer her calls.
</p>
<p>
O man of sorrow, whose life is interwoven with the ills of the earth!
Could I but speak to you in the language of the truth or had I but room
to draw the picture as it is, I think your reason would revolt at its
use, and break its chains, bidding defiance to the deadly grasp of its
seditious habits.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;When you become satisfied that tobacco is injurious to you. If you
have not courage to divorce the habit at once and had rather steal away
from its grasp unconsciously and without the desire for tobacco, or the
use of medicine, just send 50 cts. in money or stamps to the office of
the <span class="sc">Gospel Monitor. Hannibal, Mo.</span> And we will send you the RULINGS OF
NATURE. A printed formula showing how nature in that case restores her
own equilibrium, and throws off the former poison and prevents the
craving of a fresh supply. In clubs of 20 or more, we will send them
for 25 cts. each. The rule is short and easily understood.

<p>
The mind of man is the motive power of the body. There is great sympathy
existing between the mind and body, whatever affects the body must of
necessity affect the mind; versus. Whatever affects the mind is sure to
affect the body. The body is the house that the man lives in, if the
house is damaged in any way the man proper which is the mind; through
sympathy is sure to suffer from such injuries.
</p>
<p>
The power of the mind over the body both in disease and in health, is
utterly beyond all the modern scientific conceptions. The mind has so
long been clogged and hindered by narcotics and over stimulants, that
it yet remains in its infancy. Every hindrance prevents the growth and
development of the mind. The body may soon attain to its greatest
development, but the mind never reaches its perfection in this sphere.
</p>
<p>
Age and experience fortifies and strengthens the mind, they give it
greatness and power; every influence possible should be brought to
bear upon the intellect to improve the mind and advance it.&mdash;The ages
past have been more to hinder and to cramp the intellect, to hinder
reason and progress than to favor it. But it must be understood now
that mind is capable of getting and bringing information from the
ulter-etherial worlds. Or of mind conversing with mind, even in
separate continents.&mdash;Without Telephone, Telegraph, or <i>Witch-craft</i>.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
